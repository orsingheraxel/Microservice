# Microservice
Project about microservices. In this project, I used Eureka, Config Server and Gateway.
This is about a microservice that register Students and Courses. The conextion is when a course searches its students. 
In a few days IÂ´ll try to integrate this project with Apache Kafka. Kafka will be used when a Student changes some important attribute. This event will cause the topic to send a notification to the course.
